>>>IDEA: this problem is a typical modulo arithmetic,
it's very basic but fun,
you just need to loop through the range 1 to n and assign num1 as the collective sum of numbers whose modulo of m is not zero,
then do the same thing for num2 but for modulo m is zero.
then simply return num1-num2

--Code

function differenceOfSums(n, m) {
	let num1 = 0;
	for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (i % m !== 0) {
			num1 += i;
		}else{
			num2 += i;
		}
	}
	return num1-num2;
