>>>IDEA: it's a fairly simple problem, you just need to modulo the number, and add it to over an iterative, but don't forget the rank ( 10^x), so you also have to multiply it in order to increase the rank and not just add the numbers solely, and you can handle negative values at first becuase none of them will be a palindrome.

--Code:

function isPalindrome(num) {
	let y = num;
	let inverse = 0;
	while (y !== 0) {
		inverse = (inverse*10) + (y%10);
		y = (y - (y%10)) / 10;
	}
	if (inverse === num){
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}
