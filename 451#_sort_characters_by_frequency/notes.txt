>>>IDEA: 
i had the idea but i didn't know how to sort the dict exactly, so i asked  Gemini, and after a couple of minutes reviewing the code, i figured that the sort function essentially is just destructing the elements of the passed parameters, off-course that's according to the nature of the passed parameters and how you want to destruct them, the syntax is actually a little weird for the sort function, because the comma (,) means to ignore this element of the array and moreover the freqB - freqA means to sort in decreasing order, there is actually a bunch of option which i can't remember off-course , But the overall logic is fairly simple, you just need to build the object from that one time pass through the string, then you have - which is the hard part i guess  - to sort the object based on the frequency, then finally return the new string after off-course looping on the sorted object and appending the chars one by one repeated with their number of frequency.

--Code:

function frequencySort (s) {
    
    let freq = new Map();
    
    for (let char of s){
        freq[char] = (freq[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    const sortedChars = Object.entries(freq).sort(([, freqA], [, freqB]) => freqB - freqA);
    
    let result = "";

    for (const [char, freq] of sortedChars){
        result += char.repeat(freq);
    }
    
    return result;
}
