>>>IDEA: the idea is fairly simple, and i almost forgot that we have something in programming called "control flow labels", yes my friend, those labels will be very handy when looping, because like this problem, what if i want to stop the loop the moment i get what i want, there is no need and no point in keeping the loop iterating right ?

function findWordsContaining(words, x) {
	let n = words.length;
	let arr = [];

	out:for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		let w = words[i];
		for (let j = 0; j < w.length; j++) {
			if (w[j] === x){
				arr.push(i);
				continue out;
			}
		}
	}
	return arr;
}
