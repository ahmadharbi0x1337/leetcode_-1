>>>IDEAD: firstly, an anagram means a word that can be shaped out of the exact length and characters of the original word.
example : cat is an angram of tac or act, but it's not for car or acts.
you see one character difference is not permit.

now the idead is simple, firstly check for the length
then build a dict, and insert keys as characters and values as their frequeceny.
next is to compate each char from s to each char from t, you also have to decrement the frequecny of the char.

I foreget to decrement the frequency

--Code

function isAnagram(s, t) {
	if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
	let obj = {};
	for (let i of s) {
		if (ob[i]){
			obj[i]++;
		}else{
			obj[i] = 1;
		}
	}
	for (let i of t) {
		if (!obj[i]) {
			return false;
		}
		if (--obj[i] === 0) delete obj[i];
	}
	return true;
}
